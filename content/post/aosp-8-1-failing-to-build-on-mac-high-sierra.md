If you're trying to build AOSP on Mac High Sierra and getting this (or a similar error):

It means that bison isn't working. If you try running bison by running this command for example:

    ./prebuilts/misc/darwin-x86/bison/bison

it fails on error

    Illegal instruction: 4

The solution to this is to fix bison, since it's broken on High Sierra, by applying this patch from the folx at Mac Ports- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macports/macports-ports/14451f57e89/devel/bison/files/secure_snprintf.patch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macports/macports-ports/14451f57e89/devel/bison/files/secure_snprintf.patch)

To apply this patch:

- Navigate to the bison source directory at:

  cd external/bison

* Save it as a plain text file as name.patch in the bison directory by coping the text and using

  pbpaste > patch-high-sierra.patch

(or any other way you'd prefer to save it)

- Apply the patch to the source code (p level depends on which dir you're currently in)

  patch -p0 < patch-high-sierra.patch

* Navigate back on the root tree

  cd ../..

- Make bison from source

  make bison

* Copy bison from the bison directory from the out directory where AOSP is looking for it

  cp ./out/host/darwin-x86/obj/EXECUTABLES/bison_intermediates/bison ./prebuilts/misc/darwin-x86/bison/bison

And that'll fix it! Now you can run the AOSP normally.
