**I moved to Berlin a few years ago, since then been working in some local companies, most recently Lottie/ Totoli at as the team's tech lead, building their kids tablet/ app.**

In San Francisco I worked at several tech giants, including:
* Quizlet as a Senior Android developer on the Mobile Infra team, working to improve the app and the development experience for all the Android teams.

* Pinterest as a Senior Android developer on the Core Experience team. Working on the app's performance
* Senior Android developer at Udemy, responsible for the Android app development and leading the development of the Android TV prototype.

I began working as a C# developer 10 years ago. I became a mobile developer 4 years ago, and released many Windows and Windows Phone apps. After moving to San Francisco in 2013, I worked for Slack on the Windows Phone app.
